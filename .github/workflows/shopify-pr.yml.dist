# This GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates or updates a Pull Request
# from the 'merchant-theme' branch (where Shopify pushes merchant changes)
# to the 'main' branch for review and merging.
#
# Key workflow steps:
# 1. Checks out the 'merchant-theme' branch with full history for accurate diffing.
# 2. Fetches the latest 'main' branch to compare changes.
# 3. Checks if there are any new changes in 'merchant-theme' compared to 'main'.
# 4. If changes exist, creates a temporary branch 'merchant-theme-pr' based on
#    'merchant-theme' and force pushes it to remote.
# 5. Creates or updates a Pull Request from 'merchant-theme-pr' to 'main'.
# 6. If no changes exist, it closes any redundant open PRs from 'merchant-theme-pr' to 'main'.#

# NOTE
# The reason this is a '.dist' file is to serve as a template or reference configuration.
# It can be copied and customized locally to avoid accidental changes to the main CI workflow.
# This pattern helps manage environment-specific or sensitive settings safely.
